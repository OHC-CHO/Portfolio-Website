            This is a purely sound design project, focusing on the design of boss and character skill effects in the game <em>Genshin Impact</em>, as well as the emotional motivation and narrative role of sound in the complete level.
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>Genshin Impact</em> is an open-world RPG developed by miHoYo, released in 2020. The visual content of this work comes from a screen recording I made while playing <em>Genshin Impact</em>. I assure that this material will be used solely for academic purposes and not for commercial use. For this project, I used Pro Tools as the DAW, with a Scarlett Solo 3 audio interface and Beyerdynamic DT 700 Pro X headphones.
        </p>
        <p>
            The sound design in <em>Genshin Impact</em> heavily relies on the visual style and gameplay mechanics. After researching relevant information, I began crafting the sounds.

          <h2>Boss Sound Design</h2>
          <p>
              The boss sound design is divided into two layers: real and surreal. The real layer includes basic burning sounds, movements, and whooshes that align with the boss’s characteristics. The surreal layer integrates with the visuals to emphasize the boss's power and oppressive presence. I highlighted low frequencies during attack actions and added animal roars in higher frequencies during key transitions (such as activation, paralysis, and revival) to enhance drama and signal the progression of the game stages. This design helps immerse the player in the sense of threat from the boss and encourages combat.
          </p>
          <p>
              For the boss's shield, which prevents damage until broken, I linked the boss’s health to the volume of its burning sound, creating an audio cue that signals the boss's vulnerability and motivates the player to attack.

          <h2>Player’s Skill Sound Design</h2>
          <p>
              The player’s skill design primarily uses high frequencies elements, incorporating weapon sounds as a base, layered with SFX and pitch-shifting to add dynamic range. Foley sounds enhance the player’s sense of involvement and achievement, making the effects of their actions and skills more apparent.
          </p>
          <p>
              Since the player’s skills are water-based, and the boss is fire-based, I incorporated high-frequency sizzling sounds during water-fire interactions to enhance immersion.

          <h2>Ambient Sound Design</h2>
          <p>
              Finally, I considered the ambient (AMB) design, which switches between battle and exploration states. In battle, ambient sounds are ducked to emphasize more critical sounds, as player attention focuses on combat. When the player exits battle, the ambient volume increases, creating a contrast to the intense battle state, creating a sense of "calm" and signifying the narrative conclusion. Since this project involved linear editing by importing video into the DAW rather than using dynamic mixing in Wwise, I manually applied sidechain compression to achieve this effect.
