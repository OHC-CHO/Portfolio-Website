                <p>
                        In recent years, climate change driven by global warming has been accelerating and threatening the ecological balance of Earth. 
                    The glaciers in the Arctic are melting at an unprecedented rate, and this extreme environmental change is causing the polar bear, 
                    a symbol of the snowy world, to gradually lose its habitat. They face not only shrinking living spaces but also food shortages 
                    and the destruction of their environment. The plight of the polar bear reflects the global environmental crisis,serving as a 
                    silent testament to the devastating effects of climate change on natural life. Meanwhile, human industrialization, with its 
                    carbon emissions and over-exploitation, exacerbates this crisis. The collapse of glaciers and the hum of industrial machinery 
                    sharply contrast the silent struggle of nature, often ignored by humanity. This work aims to use art to raise awareness about 
                    global warming and encourage a reevaluation of the human-nature relationship.

                <h2>Concept</h2>
                <p>
                    Ice_Puzzle is an interactive sound art project that tells the journey of a polar bear
                    searching for hope in a snowy world. The "treasure" in the narrative symbolizes the
                    rebuilding of nature and a shared vision for the future. During the journey, the
                    participant will experience alternating moments of crisis and hope, which not only
                    represents an exploration but also serves as a reflection on ecological fate. The project
                    conveys the message that despite the severity of global warming, even the smallest
                    actions can spark new possibilities for nature. The light of hope, though small, can
                    illuminate the path forward when we work together.

                <h2>Sound Design</h2>
                <p>
                    I designed a low-frequency rumble "storm" by layering multiple sine and triangle
                    waves, inspired by Luigi Russolo’s The Art of Noises. This sound symbolizes
                    industrial noise, reflecting the profound environmental damage caused by carbon
                    emissions. To avoid auditory fatigue, I created two versions of the sound: one with a
                    fixed base frequency and another modulated with an LFO to introduce greater
                    variability and depth.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For high frequencies, I used FM synthesis to create a "star" sound that symbolizes
                    hope. The sound is triggered by a sequencer and employs the Dorian mode to evoke a
                    subtle sense of hope.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the mid-frequency range, I incorporated a descending Shepard tone, creating
                    the illusion of a continuously falling frequency, symbolizing the unfairness of fate and
                    the helplessness of nature in the face of global warming.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I also added a looping ambient sound to enrich the frequency spectrum, creating a
                    "warm" yet uneasy texture that echoes the theme of global warming and provides
                    emotional depth.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="content-section">
                <h2>System Design</h2>
                <p>
                    Before the game starts, I set the initial positions of the polar bear and the treasure
                    using random coordinates mapped to the screen size. The interactive design allows
                    users to engage through body movements.Leveraging an open-source program from
                    GitHub, I captured hand poses through the camera and transmitted the data to my
                    main program to control the polar bear’s movements. The direction of movement is
                    determined by the mouse’s position, divided into four quadrants on the screen.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="content-section">
                <h2>Interactive Design</h2>
                <p>
                    As the design incorporates game elements, the sound interaction also follows
                    some game sound design strategies to guide the user.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The distance between the polar bear and the treasure serves as the primary
                    parameter guiding the interaction toward the final goal. I modulated the
                    low-frequency rumble with the distance between the bear and the treasure. As the
                    distance decreased, the rumble became narrower, indicating the changing proximity.
                    The “star” sound becomes more ordered as the bear approaches the treasure,
                    symbolizing the imminent realization of hope. The Shepard tone volume decreases,
                    signifying the bear’s victory over fate. Every time the bear moves, an ice crack sound
                    is triggered. The sound of cracking ice becomes louder when the bear is far from the
                    treasure and softer as it nears, creating a sense of safety and progress.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Additionally, the speed of the star's flicker is modulated by the speed of the
                    bear’s movement, further enhancing the user’s perception of speed.
