            This is a sound recording project for film. This is a field recording project for film. I selected a 4-minute segment from the rough cut, with all sounds directly captured on set without any post-production.

            <em>A Round Trip between City and Country</em> is a collaborative graduation project by the Class of 2021 directing department at Beijing Film Academy, directed by Xie Muxiao and produced by Beijing Youth Film Studio. I worked as the sound director and was involved throughout the pre-production and synchronized sound recording process. The project began preparations in June 2024, with filming taking place from October 20 to October 25, 2024. The recording equipment used includes a Sound Devices 688 recorder, two Sennheiser 416 microphones, one Sennheiser 418MS microphone, and five pairs of Lectrosonics wireless microphones. The film is currently in the editing stage and has not yet entered the sound post-production process.

          <h2>Film Overview</h2>
          <p>
              This is a realist film that explores the oppression of fate and humanity's resistance to it. The film employs long handheld shots, natural lighting, and deep focus, with non-professional actors performing in dialects to create a sense of "realism." Correspondingly, the sound design emphasizes realism, avoiding excessive embellishments and focusing on the naturalness of on-set sound, aligning with the director’s concept of “objective sound.” The sound will also be used to emphasize the film's theme of the struggle between fate and the characters.

          <h2>Sound Design Approach</h2>
          <p>
              Owing to its stylistic approach and shooting constraints, the film’s dialogue incorporates more spatial information rather than the direct sound quality typical of commercial films. Instead, it includes more spatial information. In the sound post-production phase, I plan to enhance the expression by switching between subjective and objective sound perspectives. For example, during fortune-telling or mystical object scenes, non-realistic sound effects will be mixed into the ambient sound to highlight the absurdity of fate being determined by “mysticism.” As the character’s self-awareness grows, the proportion of background noise or distractions will gradually decrease, symbolizing the character's growing ability to block out external definitions, emphasizing their subjectivity and ultimate rebellion against fate.
